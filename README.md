The basic premise is that many people have an exponential sense of history, where 30 years ago feels like twice as much as 20 years ago. This can be exploited by telling the reader about two historical facts, one twice as far removed from present day as the other. The grammar tends to be slightly confusing though.

Contributing
============

I'm really looking for contributions, especially to the historical database. I will try to keep a balance between the different types of events, so I will likely reject an IMDB dump. 

When contributing historic events, please keep the events significant to a global population.
